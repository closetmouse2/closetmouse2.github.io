Hello Professor. Fedor,

I figured I’d put in a little excerpt about where I’m at regarding everything we’ve learned so far. Feel 100% free to ignore this readme if you don’t have time to address it. 

Here are some concerns about my own document that I would like addressed by someone who knows what they’re doing. This “inquiry” document is purely for the sake of improving my skill, so I figured I’d throw in some questions/items for review.

-I want to know if my code is generally speaking “professional” from a semantics and organization perspective. 

-Tips for reducing the amount of CSS I have to write. You had mentioned the best CSS is the shortest CSS (relatively speaking) so I wanted to see if there were any habits or things I could do differently in my own code to make it more optimal. The same goes for my html. 

-I am confident in my ability to make things work and go where I want regarding CSS positioning. I also think my understanding of margin, padding, and border is pretty good on a basic level. However, I don’t think I made many very optimal choices. So, if there were any specific techniques you of know that could improve the way I do things currently I’d love to hear about them. For example, I resorted to absolute positioning in my Git section on the portfolio page. I got things to work, but upon resizing everything gets all messed up. This goes for any other section that might be poorly structured. 

Thanks for your time!
