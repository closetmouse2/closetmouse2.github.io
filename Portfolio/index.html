  <div class="terminal">
   <h2 class="title">Terminal (BASH)</h2>
   <p class="term_text">The terminal was initially intimidating due to the lack of GUI. However, with a little bit of time and elbow grease, I am able to use and navigate the terminal at a much more optimal rate than I normally would by using point and click. With that said, below I have listed a few of my strengths regarding the terminal:</p>
   <ul class="term_list">
     <li>Directory navigation</li>
     <li>Running and Opening programs</li>
     <li>Creating files and Directories</li>
     <li>Editing files</li>
   </ul>
   <p class="git_text">I am also able to use the terminal to fully operate and navigate the popular version control system “Git”. This knowledge includes but is not necessarily limited to:</p>
   <img src="../images/terminal.png" alt="image of terminal">
   <ul class="git_list">
     <li>A full knowledge of how to create, stage, and commit files.</li>
     <li>Experience in fixing minor merge conflicts.</li>
     <li>Managing projects via popular workflows.</li>
     <li>Communicating with and operating the popular 3rd party web-based hosting service “GitHub”.</li>
   </ul>
