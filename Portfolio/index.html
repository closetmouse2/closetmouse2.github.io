<!--terminal content-->
  <div class="terminal">
   <h2 class="title">Terminal (BASH)</h2>
   <p class="term_text">The terminal was initially intimidating due to the lack of GUI. However, with a little bit of time and elbow grease, I am able to use and navigate the terminal at a much more optimal rate than I normally would by using point and click. With that said, below I have listed a few of my strengths regarding the terminal:</p>
   <ul class="term_list">
     <li>Directory navigation</li>
     <li>Running and Opening programs</li>
     <li>Creating files and Directories</li>
     <li>Editing files</li>
   </ul>
   <p class="git_text">I am able to use the terminal to fully operate and navigate the popular version control system “Git”. This knowledge includes but is not necessarily limited to:</p>
   <img src="../images/terminal.png" alt="image of terminal">
   <ul class="git_list">
     <li>A full knowledge of how to create, stage, and commit files.</li>
     <li>Experience in fixing minor merge conflicts.</li>
     <li>Managing projects via popular workflows.</li>
     <li>Communicating with and operating the popular 3rd party web-based hosting service “GitHub”.</li>
   </ul>

<!--html content-->
  <div class="html" contenteditable="true">
   <h2 class="title">&lt; <strong>HTML</strong> &gt;</h2>
   <p class="html_text"><strong>&lt;p&gt;</strong> The Hypertext Markup Language was my first experience dipping my toes into the world of development. The idea that such a basic premise of operation could hold so many interesting and complex concepts caught my attention early. This provided an essential outlet for gaining confidence and developing learning techniques early on in my journey. Though I would consider my knowledge of HTML “Junior Level”, there are still some specific areas where I’m confident: <strong>&lt;/p&gt;</strong></p>

<!--Sorry in advanced for how unreadable this list is LOL!-->
   <p><strong>&lt;ul&gt;</strong></p>
   <ul class="html_list">
     <li><strong>&lt;li&gt;</strong> A good grasp on semantics. <strong>&lt;/li&gt;</strong></li>
     <li><strong>&lt;li&gt;</strong> Organized document structure. <strong>&lt;/li&gt;</strong></li>
     <li><strong>&lt;li&gt;</strong> Setting up selectors accuratley and optimally. <strong>&lt;/li&gt;</strong></li>
     <li><strong>&lt;li&gt;</strong> Problem solving when things go south. <strong>&lt;/li&gt;</strong></li>
   </ul>
   <p><strong>&lt;/ul&gt;</strong></p>

  <div class="css">
   <h2 class="title">CSS</h2>
   <p class="css_text">The transformative nature of CSS in itself taught me a lot about website structure. This in turn helped me gain a real grasp on just how websites are created. I would describe my experience in CSS as “Junior Level”. Below are a few of my strengths:</p>
   <ul class="css_list">
     <li>Using selectors optimally, accurately, and specifically.</li>
     <li>Making sure the code is organized and readable.</li>
     <li>Utilizing margin, padding, and positioning to structure websites.</li>
     <li>Flexbox properties to optimize positioning.</li>
     <li>Solving problems and learning new methods of operation.</li>
   </ul>
